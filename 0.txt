eat a plate of baked: tomato, mozzarella, basil on dough
vs
common pizza

You're not going to say:
1. cook pizza
2. serve pizza

Or even worse:
1. make dough
2. put common pizza ingredients on the dough
3. bake the dough
4. bring me the dough

That's imperative programming, we're not doing that!
That's the difference between imperative and functional.
Let's always apply the latter principle.
We want to say just make pizza. Kitchen chef has to do those things, or does he?

kitchen chef:
makeDough()
